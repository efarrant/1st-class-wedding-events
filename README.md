# Client Website Resign Project

This project is the redesign of a wedding planners website. I was given full creative control.

All the branding, logos and heading were designed using Figma by me. Examples of the designs can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/qEMYfIMq957FdBeKoG1B6G/Materials?node-id=0%3A1).
A couple of examples of the design are:

- The main redesigned logo for the business:
  <img src="./src/images/logo-white.png" />
  <br>
- One of the overlays I designed for the Services page:

  <img width="200px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 6px;" src="./src/images/services-stickers/all-things-sweet.png"/>

This also included applying my skills in Html, CSS, Javascript and Responsive development (see [here](https://github.com/efarrant/1st-class-wedding-events/blob/a39a1c716c0d06c14a5a257dfe38bcc8e883a1c9/src/style.css#L284)).

Tools/frameworks used in this project include:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for background and images
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design, wireframe and prototyping

I've also allowed the client to add addition photos to the services page and all sub-pages using a numbering system.

## Colour Themes

The dark theme was chosen for a number of reasons. The website primarily seeks to showcase the client's work in the form of galleries, and this felt most sophisticated with a dark theme. Whilst the client's brand name features the word 'weddings', she mentioned in meetings that she wanted to get across that they cater for all events, not just weddings. Since white is the dominant colour in the wedding industry, I wanted to flip this and opt for the polar opposite. I should also mention that the client does not have brand colours nor a fixed logo, so neutrality seemed the best approach. I chose #D6AF28 (gold) as an accent colour to tie in with the 'blurred lights' background and add a touch of warmth.

New website will shortly overtake the domain name: https://1stclassweddingevents.co.uk/
