      <p class="about-me-paragraph"> Welcome to our wedding website! We have built this to (hopefully) provide you with everything you need to know about our wedding day to make this as stress-free as possible for everyone. This website is currently only in the early stages of development but we wil continue to add more information as planning continues, so please do check back nearer the time. Our hope is that you will also be able to see the photos of the wedding day via this site in the New Year - but if not we will let you know how you can view these.
        To try and keep our wedding as covid-safe as possible and stand the best chance of things being able to proceed should there be new restrictions in the winter, we regret that we are only having a limited number of guests to our reception due to the size of the building. But whether you are joining us for the full day or simply to see us wed, we will be so happy to see you there!</p>

    <p class="about-me-paragraph"><br/>The wedding ceremony is being held at Hertford United Reformed Church at 1:30pm with the service taken by the Reverend Martin Legg. Hertford URC was the childhood church of Emma and we are very blessed to be able to get married here. After the ceremony, photographs will be taken outside the church before we travel to the reception venue.<br>
      There will be hand sanitiser available on entry and exit from the church, and whilst we will not be wearing face masks during the ceremony, we more than understand if you would prefer to wear one.
