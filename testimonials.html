Claire and the team did an absolutely beautiful job of dressing my wedding venue, I was so pleased with how everything looked and it was exactly how I wanted it to be. 
I knew what I wanted and Claire absolutely understood from the moment I spoke to her. Claire was very much on my wavelength when we spoke about the venue and the styling and absolutely delivered. 
Claire made my chairs look beautiful with gorgeous waterfall drapes and gorgeous clasps, a postbox and easels for my welcome signs ‚ù§Ô∏è

"HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Claire and her team are the people you need for your wedding. From the minute I booked in with Claire she stayed in contact and answered any questions I had straight away. 1st Class Wedding Events provided us with a dance floor, chair covers, sequin runners, light up letters, table plan mirror, balloon arch, table mirrors and even fairy lights for the trees outside! The barn looked absolutely stunning, thank you for making our dream wedding come together!
